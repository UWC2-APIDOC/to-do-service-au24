# Quick start: Set your first reminder
So, here we are. It's Monday morning. You've barely had time to take a sip of your first coffee and already life is out of control.

So many sticky notes, so little time, as they say.

Time to take control of the chaos. Time to create your first task and set a rminder with To-Do service.

It will be ready by the time you next cup of coffee is ready to enjoy.

## Prerequisite
To use the To-Do service, you need a user account. Read all about it in our first tutorial [Enroll a new user](https://uwc2-apidoc.github.io/to-do-service-au24/tutorials/enroll-a-new-user.html).


## Create your first task and reminder
1. Log into the To-Do service with your account details.
2. In the menu bar (at the top), select **Add new task**.
3. In the **Title** field, give your task a name. For example, Amy's dental check-up.
4. In the **Description** field, provide a little more details about your task.
5. From the **Calendar**, select the **Due Date and Time** for the task.

   For this example, we'll choose today's date in 10 minutes from now.
7. In the next drop-down list, set the **Time** you want to receive the reminder.

   It will display as a negative number, indicating the number of minutes before the due time.

   For this example, enter -3.
9. Select **Save** to save your first task.

Time to boil the kettle and freshen up that cuppa. In a few minutes, To-Do will send you an email notification to remind you of Amy's appointment.

This is just the beginning. You can repeat these simple steps to create more tasks and reminder. 
Make sure you re-read our tutorial [Enrol a new user](https://uwc2-apidoc.github.io/to-do-service-au24/tutorials/enroll-a-new-user.html). How about creating more user accounts for the family and assigning chores?

You can raise your cup to that.
