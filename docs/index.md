## API reference docs

Detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.
