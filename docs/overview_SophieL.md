# To-Do service

## Sometimes life feels like a circus act

A three-ring circus.

Too many balls in the air, and then

## Boom! Crash!

You miss and it's game over, total chaos.

1. Create your first task
2. Enter the due date.
3. Set the a reminder.

## Set it. We won't forget it.

To-Do service will send you a message on your favourite device when the task is due.

We'll keep all your balls in the air for you, without dropping a single one.

Now, you can focus on that juggling tutorial on YouTube.

Life can be that easy. If you don't believe us, try our demo.
