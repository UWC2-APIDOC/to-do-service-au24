# To-Do service API

**Organize your tasks and avoid missing deadlines!**

The To-Do service facilitates the completion of your to-do lists by allowing you to manage your tasks and receive reminders of when they are due.

## Get started

Learn how to:

* [Enroll a new user](tutorials/enroll-a-new-user.md)
* [Add a new task](tutorials/add-a-new-task.md)
* Change the due-date of a task _(coming soon)_
* Delete a task _(coming soon)_

## API reference

The To-Do service API is a REST API with the following resources:

* [User](api/user.md)
* [Task](api/task.md)

**Note:** The docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service. When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
