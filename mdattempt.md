# Markdown as documentation notation

### Advantages
* Markdown language seems straightforward. There are many guides you can easily reference, [like this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Because the formatting is so simple, documentation tends to be less noisy and easier to digest.
* Since it uses plain text, it's compatible with various softwares and file types.

### Disadvantages
* The lack of formatting flexibility can hinder efforts at creativity in documentation.
* You can't see what your formatting looks like as you're creating it; you need to commit changes and check on it.
